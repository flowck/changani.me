inside component methods.","cover":"blog-images/accessing-filters.jpg","_content":"\nI've written this article before, but unfortunately, it got lost on one of my million blogs. \n\nFilters are one of my favorite features from Vuejs, they are easy to implement and are pretty handy to manipulate or format text inside the template tags. \n\nIf you are not familiar with Filters in Vuejs, here is a more formal concept:\n\n>Vue.js allows you to define filters that can be used to apply common text formatting.\n\n**Example:** Filter to formate a number to USD.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"product\">\n  <span class=\"product__price\">{{ price | formatPriceToMoney }}</span>\n</div>\n```\n\n<br />\n\n```javascript\nnew Vue({\n  el: \"#app\",\n  filters: {\n    formatPriceToMoney(value) {\n      if (value) {\n        return value.toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { currency: \"USD\" });\n      } else {\n        return 0.0;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Filters scope\n\n**Local filters (component)** are defined inside components, within the property `filters` inside the component declaration, as shown in the example above. \n\n**Global filters** are defined directly from the `Vue` insctance object, by calling the method `.filter(filterName, filterHandler(value) => value)`:\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from \"vue\";\n\nVue.filter(\"formatePriceToMoney\", value => {\n  return value.toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { currency: \"USD\" });\n});\n```\n\nGlobal filters give you the advantage of reusing it across components, without having to worry about reimplementing its logic again, this means that the filter defined above can be used inside any component since it was directly implemented inside the main vue instance.\n\n\n\n## Calling a global filter inside of component method or hook lifecycle hook\n\nAs seen above, you can reuse any global filter across any component template, but what if you need to format data inside methods or lifecycle hooks with some logic that you've already implemented as a filter?\n\nBefore you ask yourself, why would I need that, here are some reasons:\n\n* When you need to pass formatted data to a third party component.\n* When you need to pass formatted data to a presentational component.\n\n  \nYou can perform such action by calling the filter as if it was a method using the `this.$options.filters` property. \n\n**Example:** Fomating an array of numbers using `.map()` function and `this.$options.filters`\n\n```html\n<script>\n  export default {\n    name: \"ListCars\",\n    data() {\n      return {\n        prices: [1200, 5400, 12.2, 0.9]\n      }\n    },\n    methods: {\n      getPricesFormated() {\n        return this.prices.map(price => {\n          return this\n            .$options\n            .filters\n            .formatePriceToMoney(price);\n        });\n      }\n    },\n    created(){\n      // Access filter inside of a lifecycle hook\n      console.log(this.$options.filters.formatePriceToMoney(5000));\n

You've probably known or heard this term somewhere, so before going into specific implementation details, let me explain or refresh you about the concurrent part using Wikipedia:\n\n>In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **concurrency** is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in the partial order, without affecting the outcome.

Inside of the call back it's required a special either `true` or `false` as the result of the operation to assure the existence or non-existence of the element inside of the array.\n\n### Searching/filtering an element of type Number\n\n```javascript\nconst x = [0, 1, 20, 4, 5];\n\nconsole.log(\n\tx.filter(item => item === 4)\n);\n\n// 4\n```\n\n\n\n## Searching for objects\n\nTo search for an object inside of an array, you as a developer will need to know the structure of the object and then write a callback function that fits that exact data structure.\n\n\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nconst listOfNames = [\n  {\n    name: \"Firmino\",\n    age: 23\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Gonçalves\",\n    age: 19\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Changani\",\n    age: 8\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Nelson\",\n    age: 67\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Mandela\",\n    age: 34\n  }\n];\n\nconst result = listOfNames.filter(\n  item => {\n    return item.name.search(new RegExp(\"MANDELA\", \"i\")) >= 0;\n  }\n);\n\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\nThe code above is way more complex than the first example, but the essence is exactly the same:\n\n* An array `listOfNames` was defined with several objects, each with two properties: `name` and `age`\n* I am filtering `listOfNames` array and assigning the result to the `result` constant.\n* Inside the callback function, I am calling the `.search()` method from `item.name` to search for the string `MANDELA`. Since `.search()` is case sensitive while searching, I am passing a regular expression with the option `i` for case insensitive, instead of plain string.\n* `.search` either returns `-1` meaning not match, or it returns a positive integer starting from `O`. For this reason I defined a comparison to get `true` or `false` returned by the callback function.\n\n\n\n## A general solution\n\nThe code above works, but I decided to work on a general approach that would also allow a program to set the object property to be used as a search parameter, and also support `Numbers`.\n\n```javascript\n/*\n* search: It return an array of elements that match the search condition\n* @param {Array} arr\n* @param {String} prop\n* @param {String/Number} param\n* @returns {Array}\n*/\nfunction search(arr = [], prop, param) {\n  const searchParam = new RegExp(param, \"i\");\n  return arr.filter(\n    item => {\n      return new String(item[prop]).search(searchParam) >= 0;\n    }\n  );\n}\n```\n\n* The search function receives 3 arguments: `arr` an Array of objects, `prop` the property to be used as search/filtering parameter, and `param` which represents the actual value we expect the `.search()` to match\n* To improve the readability, I assigned the regular expression declaration to `searchParam` constant\n* And to support `Number`, I decided to wrap `item[prop]` inside of `new String()`. This means that each property value would be converted to `String`.\n* And last, since the function doesn't know which object property would be used as a search parameter, I decided to access the property by using square brackets `item[prop]`.\n\n\n\nThis function could be improved, with things like parameter validation, support for nested objects and so on, but for the sake of simplicity, I decided to leave it just like it is right now. \n\n\n\n## References\n\n[String.prototype.search()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search)\n\n[Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)\n\n[Post cover by Aurelien Romain](https://unsplash.com/photos/ge2mkvxvS_Q)","source":"_posts/Searching-inside-of-an-array-of-objects.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Searching inside of an array of objects - Javascript\ndate: 2020-02-10 17:57:20\nmetatags: javascript\ndescription: Searching inside of an array of objects using .filter() and .search() methods in Javascript.\ncover: \"blog-images/searching-inside-of-an-array-of-objects.jpg\"\n---\n\nOne of my favorite methods from the `Arrays` object, is the `.filter()` method. it allows javascript programs to search for an element inside of an array.

This means that each row will have a sequential `id` starting from `1`.\n\n### User migration file\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.createTable('users', {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        autoIncrement: true,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: Sequelize.INTEGER\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: Sequelize.STRING\n      },\n    });\n  },\n  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.dropTable('users');\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis is a classical approach and works perfectly, but when your application needs to expose data to the outside world, for instance, through a REST API, HTTP API or even GraphQL, special attention is required to the `id` column to avoid common situations like:\n\n* Users trying to guess the table records frrom the primary key value\n* A rare and extreme situation, your database may ran out of integers, just like it happend to [Basecamp](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/update-on-basecamp-3-being-stuck-in-read-only-as-of-nov-8-9-22am-cst-c41df1a58352).\n\n> Read the article [BIGINT v INT. Is there a big deal?](http://ronaldbradford.com/blog/bigint-v-int-is-there-a-big-deal-2008-07-18/)\n\nIf you want to learn more about the pros and cons of using UUIDs as primary key, here are two blog posts that may enlight you:\n\n* [UUID or GUID as Primary Keys? Be Careful!](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/update-on-basecamp-3-being-stuck-in-read-only-as-of-nov-8-9-22am-cst-c41df1a58352)\n* [Do you really need a UUID/GUID?](https://rclayton.silvrback.com/do-you-really-need-a-uuid-guid)\n\n\n\n> UUIDs will consume extra space in your database due to the length of each UUID value. Also, keep in mind that indexing a column with a complex value like a UUID may cause performance issues.\n\n\n\n## Using UUIDs\n\nThe Sequelize module has already prebuilt properties that will help define the data type and generate UUIDs in execution time. Let's procede by refactoring the migration file:\n\n### User migration\n\n```javascript\n// Migration\n\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.createTable('users', {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: Sequelize.UUID,\n        defaultValue: Sequelize.UUIDV4\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: Sequelize.STRING\n      },\n    });\n  },\n  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.dropTable('users');\n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn the code above the following changes were made:\n\n* The property `autoIncrement` was removed. There's no point in having it since the UUID datatype is not incrementable.\n* The property `type`  received the value `Sequelize.UUID`\n* The property `defaultValue` was added and assigned the value `Sequelize.UUIDV4`, so every time an `INSERT` operation is made, Sequelize will take care of the process of generating a new UUID value, on this case, it will use the [version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)), which is purely random.\n\n### User model\n\nTo keep the database base definition consistent across the project codebase, the changes in the migration files need to reflect in the User model file too.\n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {\n  const users = sequelize.define('users', {\n  \tid: {\n    \tallowNull: false,\n\t    primaryKey: true,\n    \ttype: DataTypes.UUID,\n    \tdefaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4\n    },\n    name: DataTypes.STRING,\n  }, {});\n  users.associate = function(models) {\n    // associations can be defined here\n  };\n  return users;\n};\n```\n\nJust like in the migration file: \n\n* The property `autoIncrement` was removed\n* The `type` property was changed to UUID, but this time, using the object `DataTypes` instead of `Sequelize`\n* It was added the property `defaultValue` and it receives the value `DataTypes.UUIDV4`\n\nThat's all you need to have UUIDs working with Sequelize. \n\n\n## Another use cases for UUIDs\n\nI have other two use cases for UUIDs as the data type of columns: \n\n* **Email account verification**: when a user is created, a unique token is generated so the user can verify his account. In this case, a link with the same token is sent to the user's mail address, once the user clicks on it, the column holding the token is updated to `null`.\n* **Password reset**: when the user resets his password, a mail with a token is sent to his email account. In this case, when the user clicks in the link, if the expiry date is less or equal than the current time, then the column holding the token is set to `null`. \n\nFor both cases I usually have the following columns:\n\n* `mailConfirmationToken : UUID`\n* `passwordResetToken : UUID`\n* `passwordResetTokenExpiryDate : Date`\n\n### User migration\n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.createTable('users', {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: Sequelize.UUID,\n        defaultValue: Sequelize.UUIDV4\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: Sequelize.STRING\n      },\n      mailConfirmationToken: {\n        type: Sequelize.UUID\n      },\n      passwordResetToken: {\n        type: Sequelize.UUID\n      },\n      passwordResetTokenExpiryDate: {\n        type: Sequelize.DATE\n      }\n    });\n  },\n  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.dropTable('users');\n  }\n};\n```\n\n\n\n### User model\n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {\n  const users = sequelize.define('users', {\n  \tid: {\n    \tallowNull: false,\n\t    primaryKey: true,\n    \ttype: DataTypes.UUID,\n    \tdefaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4\n    },\n    name: DataTypes.STRING,\n    mailConfirmationToken: DataTypes.UUID,\n    passwordResetToken: DataTypes.UUID,\n    passwordResetTokenExpiryDate: DataTypes.DATE\n  }, {});\n  users.associate = function(models) {\n    // associations can be defined here\n  };\n  return users;\n};\n```\n\n\n## References\n\n* [UUIDs are Popular, but Bad for Performance — Let’s Discuss](https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/11/22/uuids-are-popular-but-bad-for-performance-lets-discuss/)\n* [Universally unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random))\n* [Post cover by Samantha Lam](https://unsplash.com/photos/zFy6fOPZEu0) \n\n","source":"_posts/Sequelize-and-UUID-as-primary-key.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Sequelize and UUID as primary key\ndate: 2020-02-06 14:07:25\nmetatags: database, sequelize, orm\ndescription: Understand how you can use UUIDs as a primary key on Sequelize ORM\ncover: \"blog-images/sequelize-and-uuid-as-primary-key.jpg\"\n---\n\nBy default sequelize models and migrations are generated with the column `id` as the primary key, the data type set to `INTEGER` and, with the option `autoIncrement` set to `true`. This means that each row will have a sequential `id` starting from `1`.\n\n### User migration file\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.createTable('users', {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        autoIncrement: true,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: Sequelize.INTEGER\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: Sequelize.STRING\n      },\n    });\n  },\n  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n    return queryInterface.dropTable('users');\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis is a classical approach and works perfectly, but when your application needs to expose data to the outside world, for instance, through a REST API, HTTP API or even GraphQL, special attention is required to the `id` column to avoid common situations like:\n\n* Users trying to guess the table records frrom the primary key value\n* A rare and extreme situation, your database may ran out of integers, just like it happend to [Basecamp](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/update-on-basecamp-3-being-stuck-in-read-only-as-of-nov-8-9-22am-cst-c41df1a58352).\n\n> Read the article [BIGINT v INT.

There's no point in having it since the UUID datatype is not incrementable.\n* The property `type`  received the value `Sequelize.UUID`\n* The property `defaultValue` was added and assigned the value `Sequelize.UUIDV4`, so every time an `INSERT` operation is made, Sequelize will take care of the process of generating a new UUID value, on this case, it will use the [version 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)), which is purely random.\n\n### User model\n\nTo keep the database base definition consistent across the project codebase, the changes in the migration files need to reflect in the User model file too.\n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nmodule.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {\n  const users = sequelize.define('users', {\n  \tid: {\n    \tallowNull: false,\n\t    primaryKey: true,\n    \ttype: DataTypes.UUID,\n    \tdefaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4\n    },\n    name: DataTypes.STRING,\n  }, {});\n  users.associate = function(models) {\n    // associations can be defined here\n  };\n  return users;\n};\n```\n\nJust like in the migration file: \n\n* The property `autoIncrement` was removed\n* The `type` property was changed to UUID, but this time, using the object `DataTypes` instead of `Sequelize`\n* It was added the property `defaultValue` and it receives the value `DataTypes.UUIDV4`\n\nThat's all you need to have UUIDs working with Sequelize. \n\n\n## Another use cases for UUIDs\n\nI have other two use cases for UUIDs as the data type of columns: \n\n* **Email account verification**: when a user is created, a unique token is generated so the user can verify his account.

There’s no point in having it since the UUID datatype is not incrementable.</li>\n<li>The property <code>type</code>  received the value <code>Sequelize.UUID</code></li>\n<li>The property <code>defaultValue</code> was added and assigned the value <code>Sequelize.UUIDV4</code>, so every time an <code>INSERT</code> operation is made, Sequelize will take care of the process of generating a new UUID value, on this case, it will use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">version 4</a>, which is purely random.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"User-model\"><a href=\"#User-model\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"User model\"></a>User model</h3><p>To keep the database base definition consistent across the project codebase, the changes in the migration files need to reflect in the User model file too.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">&#39;use strict&#39;;\nmodule.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) =&gt; {\n  const users = sequelize.define(&#39;users&#39;, {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: DataTypes.UUID,\n        defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4\n    },\n    name: DataTypes.STRING,\n  }, {});\n  users.associate = function(models) {\n    // associations can be defined here\n  };\n  return users;\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Just like in the migration file: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The property <code>autoIncrement</code> was removed</li>\n<li>The <code>type</code> property was changed to UUID, but this time, using the object <code>DataTypes</code> instead of <code>Sequelize</code></li>\n<li>It was added the property <code>defaultValue</code> and it receives the value <code>DataTypes.UUIDV4</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s all you need to have UUIDs working with Sequelize. </p>\n<h2 id=\"Another-use-cases-for-UUIDs\"><a href=\"#Another-use-cases-for-UUIDs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Another use cases for UUIDs\"></a>Another use cases for UUIDs</h2><p>I have other two use cases for UUIDs as the data type of columns: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email account verification</strong>: when a user is created, a unique token is generated so the user can verify his account. In this case, a link with the same token is sent to the user’s mail address, once the user clicks on it, the column holding the token is updated to <code>null</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Password reset</strong>: when the user resets his password, a mail with a token is sent to his email account. In this case, when the user clicks in the link, if the expiry date is less or equal than the current time, then the column holding the token is set to <code>null</code>. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For both cases I usually have the following columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>mailConfirmationToken : UUID</code></li>\n<li><code>passwordResetToken : UUID</code></li>\n<li><code>passwordResetTokenExpiryDate : Date</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"User-migration-1\"><a href=\"#User-migration-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"User migration\"></a>User migration</h3><pre><code class=\"javascript\">&#39;use strict&#39;;\nmodule.exports = {\n  up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) =&gt; {\n    return queryInterface.createTable(&#39;users&#39;, {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: Sequelize.UUID,\n        defaultValue: Sequelize.UUIDV4\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: Sequelize.STRING\n      },\n      mailConfirmationToken: {\n        type: Sequelize.UUID\n      },\n      passwordResetToken: {\n        type: Sequelize.UUID\n      },\n      passwordResetTokenExpiryDate: {\n        type: Sequelize.DATE\n      }\n    });\n  },\n  down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) =&gt; {\n    return queryInterface.dropTable(&#39;users&#39;);\n  }\n};</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"User-model-1\"><a href=\"#User-model-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"User model\"></a>User model</h3><pre><code class=\"javascript\">&#39;use strict&#39;;\nmodule.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) =&gt; {\n  const users = sequelize.define(&#39;users&#39;, {\n      id: {\n        allowNull: false,\n        primaryKey: true,\n        type: DataTypes.UUID,\n        defaultValue: DataTypes.UUIDV4\n    },\n    name: DataTypes.STRING,\n    mailConfirmationToken: DataTypes.UUID,\n    passwordResetToken: DataTypes.UUID,\n    passwordResetTokenExpiryDate: DataTypes.DATE\n  }, {});\n  users.associate = function(models) {\n    // associations can be defined here\n  };\n  return users;\n};</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"References\"><a href=\"#References\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"References\"></a>References</h2><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/11/22/uuids-are-popular-but-bad-for-performance-lets-discuss/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UUIDs are Popular, but Bad for Performance — Let’s Discuss</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Universally unique identifier</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/zFy6fOPZEu0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Post cover by Samantha Lam</a> </li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"Using SASS variables inside vue components","date":"2020-01-22T22:06:00.000Z","metatags":"vuejs, sass","description":"Learn how to use SASS variables inside vue components.","cover":"blog-images/using-sass-variables-inside-vue-components.png","_content":"\n[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) is one of the first CSS [preprocessors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor), it was developed in 2006 by Natalie Weizenbaum, Chris Eppstein, and Hampton Catlin.
